Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, affecting millions of people annually. It encompasses a range of cardiovascular conditions that impact the heart's functionality, such as coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and arrhythmias. Early detection is crucial to prevent severe complications and improve patient outcomes.

About this project

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on medical data using machine learning algorithms.
